# Reddit Bot: Rock, Paper, Scissors

Resolve disputes with civility!

### Currently:

* Utilizes Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW).
* Replies to user mentions to initiate a Rock, Paper, Scissor match.
* Parties to the match then private message the bot.
* After 5 minutes (or the above) the bot replies with the result.
* Still need to host it on Heroku -- not running continuously.
